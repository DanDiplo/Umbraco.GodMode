# Umbraco GodMode
**Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco developers invincible!**

This custom tree in the **Settings** section of **Umbraco 10+** allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers, services and models. It also provides diagnostics about your Umbraco set-up and the server it is running on.

For instance, you can:

* Quickly search doc types, templates, editors, media etc.
* Easily see which doc types inherit from any of your compositions
* See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
* Distinguish between element types and types that vary by culture or segment
* See which partials are used by all your templates (and which are cached)
* Find out which data types are being used (or not)
* View all content pages in a searchable and filterable table (using fast, server-side pagination)
* View all Umbraco members and filter them by assigned group
* Browse all media in the Media Library and filter by type
* List all tags and the content associated with the tag. Find orphaned tags
* See which controllers (Surface, API and RenderMvc) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
* View all generated models (that inherit from `PublishedContentModel`)
* View services injected into the IOC container, registered Content and URL Finders
* Clear internal Umbraco caches and even stop App Pool (danger!)
* View diagnostics and configuration settings about your Umbraco site and hosting environment
* Warm up compilation of all templates ("views") in a single bound... erm, click.
