# Umbraco GodMode
**Diplo God Mode makes Umbraco developers invincible!**

This custom tree in the **Settings** section of **Umbraco 10** allows you to browse, query and search your document types and compositions; your templates and partials; your datatypes and property editors; your media library; your custom controllers and models. It also provides diagnostics about your Umbraco set-up and the server it is running on.

For instance, you can:

* Quickly search doc types, templates, editors, media etc.
* Easily see which doc types inherit from any of your compositions
* See which document types use which property editor or data type instance
* Distinguish between element types and types that vary by culture or segment
* See which partials are used by all your templates (and which are cached)
* Find out which data types are being used (or not)
* View all content pages in a searchable and filterable table (using fast, server-side pagination) and view nuCache data
* View all Umbraco members and filter them by assigned group
* Browse all media in the Media Library and filter by type
* See all tags and tagged content, with option to delete tags
* See which controllers (`Surface`, `API` and `Render`) are being used and in what namespaces and DLLs
* View all generated models (that inherit from `PublishedContentModel`)
* Clear internal Umbraco caches and even restart App Pool
* View diagnostics and configuration settings about your Umbraco site and hosting environment
* Warm up compilation of all templates ("views") in a single bound... erm, click.
* Plus lots more!

**Note:** The 10.x version is for Umbraco 10. The 9.x version is for Umbraco 9. Use 2.x for Umbraco 8 or 1.x for Umbraco 7.
